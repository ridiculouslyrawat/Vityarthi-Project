Project Statement: Task Manager CLI

Problem Statement

In a fast-paced daily environment, individuals often struggle to keep track of immediate tasks and responsibilities. Reliance on mental notes leads to forgetfulness, while commercial task management software can be overly complex, expensive, or slow to load for simple needs. There is a lack of lightweight, immediate, and distraction-free tools for users who prefer a terminal-based workflow to manage their daily agenda effectively.

Scope of the Project

The Task Manager CLI is designed as a focused, single-session utility for task tracking.

In-Scope: * Command-Line Interface (CLI) for user interaction.

In-memory management of task lists (creation, updates, and viewing).

Input validation for task selection.

A logical menu-driven loop for continuous operation.

Out-of-Scope: * Data persistence (database/file storage) across system reboots.

Multi-user authentication or cloud synchronization.

Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Target Users

Students: For tracking study topics, assignments, or daily chores.

Developers/Programmers: Who prefer staying within the terminal environment and need a quick tool to list coding sub-tasks.

Professionals: For maintaining a temporary "scratchpad" of to-do items during a work session.

High-Level Features

Bulk Initialization: Users can define the size of their workload and input multiple tasks at the start of the session.

Task Creation: A specific module to append new urgent tasks to the list as they arise.

Task Modification: Allows users to correct or update specific task entries without rewriting the entire list.

Dashboard View: Instant display of all pending tasks to provide a clear overview of the day's objectives.
